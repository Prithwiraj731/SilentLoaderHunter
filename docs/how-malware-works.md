# How Scheduled Task Loaders Work

## Overview

Modern Windows malware often uses the Task Scheduler as a persistence mechanism.

Instead of placing obvious startup entries, attackers create hidden scheduled tasks that execute PowerShell silently.

## Typical Malicious Command Pattern
powershell.exe -NoP -Exec Bypass -W Hidden -Command "iex(irm )"
---

## What Each Flag Means

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| -NoP | No PowerShell profile loaded |
| -Exec Bypass | Ignore execution policy restrictions |
| -W Hidden | Run window hidden |
| irm | Invoke-RestMethod (download remote content) |
| iex | Invoke-Expression (execute downloaded code) |

---

## Why Attackers Use This

- Remote code execution
- Silent background execution
- Avoid antivirus heuristics
- Persistence after reboot
- Easy payload updates from remote server

---

## Common Red Flags

- `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
- `-W Hidden`
- `iex(`
- `irm`
- Hex IP addresses (e.g. 0xc0.0x6d.0xc8.0x3f)
- Scheduled tasks outside Microsoft folders

---

## Why Task Scheduler?

Task Scheduler:

- Runs at startup
- Runs at logon
- Runs on event trigger
- Blends with legitimate system tasks
- Often ignored by casual users

Understanding this technique is critical for defensive analysis.
